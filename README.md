# Portfolio

This project is intended to showcase my other projects, as well as provide some details about myself. Extra features to help improve the UI and UX have been added, such as responsiveness or transition animations. 

The code consists of basic HTML/CSS and Javascript. A package called swup has also been added in order to simplify creating a page to page transition.

## General Thoughts

Since I intended to make this project in pure HTML/CSS and JS, while also brushing up on general knowledge of those languages, the complexity of the project was quite low. The main improvements I focused on here were using better HTML semantics, as well as swifter creation of components and pages. Eventually, I plan to host the portfolio after I have a larger selection of projects and skills to showcase.

## Installation

Clone the repository and open the index.html file in a live server.
